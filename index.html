        <h2 class="heading">General Info</h2>
        <p>
            I am a <b>UCT Chemical Engineering (BScEng)</b> graduate with a passion for <b>web development</b> and <b>software engineering</b>.
            I graduated in 2024, afterwhich I started working as a <b>data analyst</b> and <b>systems engineer</b> for a renewable energy company.<br><br>

            I enjoy facing complex problems as an engineer, and developing innovative work flows with a team to complete any task. I believe this creates
            a strong baseline of efficiency, while ensuring that everyones' ideas are heard. I am thoroughly dedicated to any project I am involved in,
            and will ensure that deadlines are continuously met with coherent results. I believe one of my strongest traits is communication, and I thrive
            in a group dynamic, finding the best way forward for all parties.<br><br>

            In my thesis I found a strong passion for the code space through data science, where I applied various models/algorithms to identify
            mass flux relationships in sea ice formation. This also made me realise the importance of agile workflows and developing a thorough project plan. Ever since,
            I have been working on improving my skillset in this regard, through various online courses/bootamps. I have gained experience in <b>Python, JavaScript, C, C#, SQL and VBA,</b>
            and have developed a number of personal projects (mostly in Python).
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading">Education</h2>
        <p>
            I went to high school in Cape Town at Reddam House ASB until 2019, afterwhich I applied and was accepted to UCT for a BSc majoring in Mathematics and Physics. After my first year,
            I realised that I was missing something really important to me: problem solving. So I looked toward engineering to provide this challenge, and was accepted into second year
            <b>Chemical Engineering</b> after completing a conversion course. Between process synthesis, numerical simulation, transient systems, and advanced thermodynamics, I learnt an abundance of 
            skills that would enable me to tackle any problem I encounter, engineering or not.<br><br>

            In my last year, I completed a thesis through the <b>MARiS</b> (Marine and Antaractic Research Centre for Innovation and Sustainability), where we captured images of sea ice formation, 
            and applied numerous DIP techniques to evaluate the rate of formation and mass flux. We used a number of packages in Python to grayscale, threshold, crop, and track salt ejection channels 
            at the boundary layer. After presenting our findings, we achieved a first class result of 76% and were awarded best poster for the year.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading">Work Experience</h2>
        <p>
            After completing my undergraduate degree, I was employed the following year by Energy Partners (Pty) Ltd, where I began as a <b>Graduate Data Analyst</b>. Initially, I was involved with evaluating 
            various <b>energy</b> and <b>tariff saving opportunities</b> for the <b>Sustainability Division</b>, but I was moved to <b>Asset Management</b> halfway through the year. I was involved with automating old Excel models using 
            <b>Selenium</b> and <b>Pandas</b> packages. I developed a number of <b>Power BI</b> reports for various clients, which entailed a lot of work in <b>Google Cloud</b> and <b>BigQuery</b> to automate the <b>ETL</b> processes and import data seamlessly.
            I was then offered a permanent contract 8 months into my year-long graduate role, which I accepted. I did more work in <b>data processing</b> and <b>integration</b>, and started working on a number of <b>APIs</b> to integrate the monitoring and reporting software respectively.
